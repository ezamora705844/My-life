        <p class="black-sand"> I would like to travel to a beach with <strong class="black">black</strong> <em class="sand">sand</em>.<br> The <strong class="black">black</strong> <em class="sand">sand</em> is something I have never experiences <br>
in my life.<br>
<ol class="black-sand">Go to the hotel.
</ol>
<ol class="black-sand">
Go to the beach and relax.

        The beach can be a dangerous place, but at the same time<br> a place of fun. I would rather think about the fun things things<br> to do then think about the bad.
